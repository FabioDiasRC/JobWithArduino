# JobWithArduino

The main arquive use arduino program for count the bees of a colony, save the number in EEPROM (internal memory in Arduino board) in space of time (in the actual code is 5 seconds, but the code are maked for easily change that);
The other folder is the initial project, but when i talked with the client he requested add a method to save numbers in memory, so i change the initial project;
The '.rar' arquives are librarys for apply in Arduino IDE, for work with a LCD screan and the EEPROM memory; 
This code only show de programing part, for apply the code in a functional project is necessary buy the eletronics compounds.
